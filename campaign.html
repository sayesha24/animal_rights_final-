        We, the undersigned, concerned citizens of India, urge the government to take immediate and effective action to address the growing menace of urban monkeys in our cities. The unchecked proliferation of monkeys poses significant threats to public safety, agricultural livelihoods, and the well-being of our communities.

        According to the Primate Research Centre, Jodhpur, over 1,000 cases of monkey bites are reported daily in Indian cities, posing grave risks to human health and safety. Additionally, in Jammu district alone, there is an annual 40-crore loss due to monkey induced crop damage.  
        
        Despite the soaring numbers of the monkey menace, the government has not taken any tangible action till date. In 2007, the Delhi government had allocated a 32.7 km2 area of land in Delhi NCR, known as the Asola Bhatti wildlife sanctuary, for the relocation of urban monkeys. Unfortunately, due to lack of management in the sanctuary, including the faulty design of the walls that allowed monkeys to readily escape and inadequate food provided to the monkeys, this endeavor failed. It is rather disheartening to see that just because of improper management and faulty planning, so many Indian citizens have to suffer from monkey bites and crop loss, and our monkeys have no place that they could call their home.
        
        Furthermore, the government said that there are insufficient number of monkey catchers to transport the monkeys to the refuge. However, this can instead be seen as an opportunity to provide employment and decrease poverty, provided that the catchers are given training and proper safety equipment to catch the monkeys.
        
        In light of these pressing issues, we implore the government to take the following actions:
        
            Restart the initiative of relocating urban monkeys to Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary. To do this, the government must
        Employ monkey catchers.
        Give proper training and safety equipment before they start their activities.
        Grow proper trees – according to primatologists and experts about 91 species must be present in the habitat to allow the monkey population to survive.
        Build proper walls in the Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary to prevent monkeys from escaping.
        2. Conduct programs for citizens living in urban areas as well as the farmers, on the practices they could follow in order to reduce monkey bites and crop loss. This may include refraining from feeding monkeys, not staring them in the eye, having proper fencing around the crops, etc.
        
        3. Make stricter laws on cutting trees in the forest to control habitat loss, thereby, preventing monkeys from migrating to urban areas.
        
        By signing this petition, we also pledge to support the government’s effort in addressing monkey menace by:
        
        -  Donating resources to the Asola Bhatti Wildlife sanctuary for it to function smoothly.
        
        -  Spreading awareness on certain practices that could limit monkey bites, such as not feeding them.
        
        -  Using India’s helpline number to catch monkeys, ensuring that the human monkey conflict is not exacerbated.
        
        Together, let us work towards creating safer, more sustainable communities for all citizens of India and the monkey population!
